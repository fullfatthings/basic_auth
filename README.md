# Basic Auth Drupal Module

Integrates Drupal user authentication with HTTP Basic Auth, while maintaining
Drupal's flood control and user access systems.

If you hit the site anonymously, you will be prompted to log in. Using
a valid site username and password, this will authenticate you as that user.
